Current world population is 8 billion or 8000 million.

Assuming 1% of world population is going to use this service, users = 80 million.

If one user is using the service 5 times a day, number of times our service is used: 5*80 million = 400 million times a day.

For peak time, when all the users are using the service at the same time, number of times our service is going to be used = 80 million times per second.

Storage:

If each user stores name, phone number and city, we need = name of 10 letters/chars and phone number of 10 letter/chars and city of 10 letters/chars = 30 chars which is 30 bytes

Side Note:
Now, unit of storage in computer science = Bit, Byte, KiloByte, MegaByte, GigaByte, TeraByte, PetaByte, ExaByte, ZettaByte, YottaByte.

Bit is 0/1, Byte is 8 Bit, KiloByte is 1000 Byte, MegaByte is 1000 KiloByte, GigaByte is 1000 MegaByte, PetaByte is 1000,000 GigaByte etc.
