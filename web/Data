All we want to do is to store and process data.


Do we process the data or store the data first?

Depends!
It depends on the context.

Many scenarios are possible, some of them are:-

We have a data hungry system with no data at all. User will provide data to us and then we will play with that data.

OR we have some small data with us and we entice the user with that and then we get more data from user.

Alright, we now have data in one way or other. What next, you might ask?
We will store the data, right? easy peasy?

Actually, our answer is a big NO.

Why?

We don't know or trust the data and we want to sanitize the data, which in turn is nothing but data processing.

So, before the data hits our storage system, we sanitize the data.

But before sanitization, let's see what do we mean by data. What's a good definition of data for our system?

So we now are talking about structure of data. Could be structured or non structured.

And there we discovered SQL vs NOSQL.
