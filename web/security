Microservice security

Some Background
Monolith - Single executable (coupled, one big bang deployment)
Microservices - Multiple executables (decoupled and independent releases can be done, scaling can be done independently)

Microservice Resiliency: If services in microservice architecture fails, we can make use of fault tolerance mechanisms like circuit breaker which is
basic implementation of primary service or provides default response.
